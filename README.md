Its an React-redux boilerplate project.

For detail see [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
For detail see [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

Also thanks to the [Chuch Noris Joke API](http://www.icndb.com)

Its an MIT Licensed project and you can do what the hell you want.

I hope you know

```sh
npm install
```

then

```sh
npm run start
```

Then you should see some funny jokes from Chuck Norris.
